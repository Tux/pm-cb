PerlMonks ChatterBox Client
==

DESCRIPTION
--

There are two executable programs, `pm-cb` and `pm-cb-g`. The former
doesn't implement a full chat client (you can't use it to post to the
ChatterBox) and is no longer supported. The latter is a graphical
client to PerlMonks' ChatterBox written in Perl and Tk.

Pull requests welcome!
